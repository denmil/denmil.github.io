Hello! My name is Denis and I'm a Computer Science student! I'll use this bloggy-thing to write stuff and things I've worked on and things I'm working on.

My reserach field is computer vision, but I'm also trying out things in computer graphics, game programming/design, modern web programming and even mobile. Truth be told, this bloggy-thingy is the result of me trying to figure out how the modern web works. Hope you enjoy your stay :D

If you want to contact me, there are options in the sidebar left. Feel free to contact me for whatever you want! I'll be glad if I can help :D
